  <p>To my dearest.. I know you're having a tough time lately. I know you're exhausted. I know you're not always in the mood to talk lately. I know you're struggling, trying your best. I know how hardworking and caring you are. I want you to know that you are doing everything you can, I can see that. I can vouch for that. You're trying your best to be alive, to stay alive. I know sometimes I don't make sense, but I'm really proud of everything you do. I may not see it physically but I am certain that you are doing your best at your job. We both get tired, we all do. I damn assure you that everything is going at its own time. I care for you as much as you care for everyone. You'd be abe to get back on your feet. You'd be able to read, write, and watch films. You'd be able to do what you want. You just need to rest, both your mind, body, emotionally.
  </p>
  <p>I'm always here.
  </p>
  <p>From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Thank you for the love and care you give. It's all I could ever ask for. I'm so grateful to have someone as amazing as you by my side. You never fail to put a smile on my face. Literally just one message from you, and I'll have the most amazing day.

  <p>The day I first sent you a message. It was such a funny interaction that day as I saw your cute instagram story which really caught my attention. Then we had our first breakfast together (which I swear to God it wasn't planned). It was really awkward but I'm glad it happened. That I got to meet you!</p>
<p>
I love you.
